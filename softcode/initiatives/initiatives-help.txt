this can be a simple number or more complex expressions like 1 + 2 + 3 - 4.

+help/create init commands 1=%ch+init [exp[ (comment)]]%cn
%tRolls the player's initiative, adding their sheet initiative to the
%toptional expression and a d10. Don't include Fast-reflexes unless
%tyou have it from a pledge.

%ch+init/npc name=exp[/exp]%cn
%tCreates a new NPC slot under the player's control and rolls
%tinitiative for them. The first number is their basic initiative
%t(dex+comp); the second is their bonus. For NPCs, the fast reflexes
%tmerit should be added as a manual bonus, but this is not the case
%tfor PCs. Four (4) is a sane default for normal humans.

%ch+init/list%cn
%tList all active initiatives, in order, one per line.

%ch+inits%cn
%tAlias of +init/list for lazy people.

+help/create init commands 2=%ch+init/setinit name=expr%cn
%tModifies an NPC's basic initiative score. This is the
%tdexterity+composure or finesse+resistence. You can't do this to PC
%twithout using the +xp command.

%ch+init/setmod name=expr%cn
%tModifies a player or NPC's manual initmod. These are the manually
%tapplied bonuses, such as pledge features or Combat Marksmanship
%t(when holding a gun) or Iaido (when holding a sword), etc. Celerity
%tand Fresh start can also be handled using this modifier. Werewolves
%tdo not need to use this when shifting (unless losing/gaining Combat
%tMarksmanship bonuses) because shifting alters stats in a way that
%tthe table will already notice.

%ch+init/setroll name=expr%cn
%tModifies a player or NPC's dice roll value.

%ch+init/clear [name]%cn
%tRemove a player's or NPC's initiative. Defaults to yours.

%ch+init/wipe%cn
%tRemove all initiatives.
